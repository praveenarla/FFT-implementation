Efficient Hardware implementation of npoint FFT algorithm using Verilog.
1) To compute 8-point DFT of a sequence via
FFT algorithm using Verilog and Xilinx
ISE/Vivado.
2) Input values range to be considered:-128 to 127 that will be provided in 2’s
complement form.
3) Output generated is in 2’s
complement representation.
